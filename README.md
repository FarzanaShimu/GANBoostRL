# Project Title: GANBoostRL - Supercharge Reinforcement Learning with GAN-based Data Augmentation

## Overview:

GANBoostRL is a powerful tool that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance Reinforcement Learning (RL) training by generating high-quality synthetic data. By seamlessly integrating GAN-based data augmentation into RL pipelines, this project aims to accelerate agent learning and improve generalization capabilities.

## Key Features:

- **GAN Integration:** Harness the capabilities of GANs to create realistic synthetic data, diversifying the training dataset for RL agents.
- **Faster Learning:** Enable RL agents to learn more efficiently with an augmented dataset, reducing the number of real-world interactions needed for effective training.
- **Improved Generalization:** Enhance the ability of RL models to generalize to new environments by exposing them to a broader range of scenarios through synthetic data.
- **Customizable Configurations:** Tailor GANBoostRL to your specific RL task with easy-to-use configuration options, allowing fine-tuning for optimal performance.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smn06/GANBoostRL.git
   cd GANBoostRL
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the settings:

   Modify the `config.yaml` file to suit your RL task and GAN preferences.

4. Run the GANBoostRL pipeline:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration Options:

Adjust the following parameters in `config.yaml` to customize GANBoostRL for your needs:

- `gan_type`: Choose the GAN architecture (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN).
- `learning_rate`: Set the learning rate for GAN training.
- `num_epochs_gan`: Define the number of epochs for GAN training.
- `rl_iterations`: Specify the number of RL training iterations.
